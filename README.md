# StellarStream (Basic MVP)

StellarStream is a basic payment streaming project for Stellar/Soroban.

Current implementation:
- Backend API with in-memory streams
- Basic React dashboard

- Implementation backlog as issue files for Drips Wave

## Folders
- `backend/`
- `frontend/`
- `contracts/`
- `issues/`

## Run
1. `cd backend && npm install && npm run dev`
2. `cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev`

Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
Backend: `http://localhost:3001`

## Drips Wave
Use issue drafts from `issues/` and create GitHub issues with complexity + points.

Suggested flow:
1. Push this repo to your GitHub organization.
2. Apply repo to Stellar Wave program in Drips.
3. Create issues from `issues/*.md`.
4. Add `stellar-wave` label and set complexity in Drips dashboard.
